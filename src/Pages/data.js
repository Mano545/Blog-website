    content:"India is a fast growing, emerging country. Various industries and areas in India are in the midst of a digital evolution. One such area is governance. To lessen the gap that is evident between the government and the citizens, the Government of India (GOI) initiated the 'Digital India' program under the leadership of Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi. The programme is designed to empower the society digitally. This initiative is not just a technological upgrade; it’s a framework designed to modernise how government services are delivered while ensuring every citizen can access the benefits of digital infrastructure. By eliminating the old way of functioning through physical paperwork, Digital India enhances the transparency and accessibility of government services digitally.What is Digital India Digital India is a campaign initiated by the Government of India in 2015 aimed at providing services to citizens electronically through enhanced online infrastructure and improved internet connectivity. The initiative encompasses plans to link rural areas with high-speed internet networks. Digital India comprises of three important sections: 1) Enhancement of secure and stable digital infrastructure, 2) Delivering government services digitally, and 3) Universal digital literacy. Digital India uses, supports, and provides vital digital infrastructure to various government programmes, viz BharatNet, Standup India, Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat. The Digital India campaign also supports industries where digitalisation is the core aspect, such as Information Technology (IT) and Business Process Management (BPO), digital communication services and electronics manufacturing. With the help of this programme, these sectors will likely double their contribution to the GDP to US$ 355-435 billion by 2025. ",

        categary:"Economy",
        content: "As the world pursues excellence through digital innovation, central banks worldwide are following the trend. One such digital innovation is the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). India has also followed in the footsteps of other developed countries and, in December 2022, launched the ‘Digital Rupee’. Over the past several years, digital transactions have been dominating the way people transact. This trend has been the primary driver of the introduction of the Digital Rupee. The launch of this digital currency is a significant step taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as it completely transforms how money is perceived, used for transactions and managed. Even though digital currency presents certain challenges, the introduction of Digital Rupee presents multiple opportunities that signify India’s move towards becoming a digitally evolving nation.What is Digital Rupee?The Digital Rupee, also known as the e-Rupee (e₹), is a digital form of Indian currency issued by the RBI. It is often mistaken for being a form of cryptocurrency. However, unlike cryptocurrency, which is decentralised and operates without a central governing body, the Digital Rupee is a sovereign currency backed by the RBI. The key aim of introducing this digital currency is to complement the existing physical currency and offer an alternative to people that is secure, efficient and convenient to conduct transactions.The Digital Rupee pilot programme was launched in December 2022. It is part of the broad initiative by the Indian government and the RBI to modernise the financial system and enhance financial inclusion while promoting the use of digital currency over physical cash. While the e-Rupee is a legal tender issued by the RBI, it is different from the way an individual holds deposits in bank accounts. It does not attract interest that is usually gained from traditional deposits. However, one’s deposits held in the bank can be converted into digital rupees and vice versa.",

        content: "Are you always sending news links to friends? Do you keep an eye on news throughout the day? Maybe it’s time for you to start your own news blog.\n\nNews isn’t all politics. Sure, you can start a national, international, city or state, or hyperlocal political news blog. But you can also start a news website focusing on investigative stories, entertainment, technology, fashion, climate – wherever your interests lie.\n\nYou don’t need a newsroom or a helicopter (though having a helicopter would be cool) to start a news blog. You can gather news from other sources, and supply your own articles and provide your take on things as you go. Getting news from other sources is easy, more on that in a minute, and setting up the site is easy.\n\nDid I say it was easy to set up a news blog?\n\nYes, I did, and yes, it is.\n\nBut you don’t have to take my word for it; I’ll show you how easy it is.\n\nWhat’s Your Big Idea?\nWhen you’re watching, reading, or listening to the news, which topics are you most interested in? What’s your particular niche?\n\nIf you can narrow it down, then you have a starting point for your news blog. Keep in mind that you can always expand to other topics or kinds of news. But starting with a solid focus and foundation is the best way to build a successful site.\n\nIf you can find an underserved niche, all the better. But if you intend to cover the same topics as a larger site or organization, don’t let that stop you. There’s always room for another voice, and your article curation and take on the news will be unique.\n\nFirst Things First, Choosing Your Web Host and Domain Name\nI promised the technical part would be easy, so I’m recommending using GreenGeeks hosting plans for your news blog. Setting up a hosting account couldn’t be easier, and the platform is optimized for WordPress.\n\nI’ll talk more about WordPress in the next section.\n\nOnce you’ve settled on a host, you need to think about the domain name for your news blog. There are a lot of new domain extensions available, but for a news site, you should stick with .com. It’s one of the oldest domain extensions, so it’s solid and traditional—the perfect match for a news site that you want readers to trust.\n\nWhen you sign up at GreenGeeks, we’ll pay for the first year of your .com domain registration. You can’t beat that.\n\nAnother thing you can’t beat—especially if your news blog will be environmentally-focused—is GreenGeeks is powered by renewable energy. If you or your readers are concerned about the resources your website uses, GreenGeeks is for you.",

Nearly one-fourth of India’s population is aged between 15–29 years, while another one-fourth falls within the 0–14 years age group. This demographic advantage makes India a well-positioned market for technology products, especially among the younger generation, which is the primary driver of demand for electronics. As a result, India’s electronics sector is experiencing significant growth supported by various government initiatives meant to position the country as a global leader. In January 2022, the government set a goal to achieve electronics production of US$ 300 billion by 2025-26, with a strong focus on improving exports of smartphone. This has helped India become the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally, with over 200 manufacturing facilities operating within the country. As consumer spending power increases, this offers substantial opportunities for international companies to enter the growing Indian market. India’s smartphone manufacturing market In 2014-15, India’s mobile phone domestic production met only 25% of the total domestic demand. However, over the last decade, India’s mobile phone manufacturing has grown considerably, reaching Rs. 4.1 lakh crore (US$ 49.27 billion) in FY24 from US$ 3 billion in FY15, driven by government initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and make in India programme. This growth has supported India to meet 97% of its domestic mobile phone demand. In 2018-19, domestic production equalled demand and since the introduction of the PLI scheme in March 2020, domestic production progressively increased from US$ 30 billion to US$ 49 billion in 2023-24. Also, mobile phone exports saw a growth of 91% in 2022-23 compared with exports in the previous year, placing smartphones among India’s top five exported products. As per the Ministry of Commerce, India's smartphone exports further rose by 42% in 2023-24, reaching a value of US$ 15.6 billion from US$ 11.1 billion in 2022-23 and becoming the country’s fourth-largest export item. Additionally, India emerged as the sixth largest global exporter of mobile phones in 2022. This growth aligns with the government’s ambitious electronics sector goals, highlighting the need for ongoing policy evaluation and support in this vital industry.",
